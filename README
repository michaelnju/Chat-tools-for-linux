			GCHAT - Readme file

gchat is an instant messenger application to communicate with people Under Linux. This is the free software in the Internet. So you can download the source code and make them in your pc.
This is created with Glade for the GUI and TCP socket for communication.
It has gchat_server and gchat_client. 
gchat_server runs in CUI and gchat_client in GUI. 

INSTALLATION:
~~~~~~~~~
For gchat_server:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Go into the 'gchat_server' directory. There will be an binary file 
named 'gchat_server'.You can straight away run that or you can compile 
the application and create a new one. To comlipe type 

  $ gcc gchat_server.c -o gchat_server -pthread

You will get the binary named 'gchat_server'. Run that!!
To add users to the gchat use the 'addUsers' binary file. 
When you run that you will get four options, add, display, delete and 
exit.Go for the option you want and you will be prompted with messages 
for all that you do. 

gchat_client:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.
***Take Notes: 
（1）. in Configure process, the makefile is automaked by the tool: automake-1.13. So, before making the source code, you need to check the version of your automake by checking "/usr/share/automake-xxx-xxx". If different from automake-1.13, you need you change the link file for example install-sh,etc.
（2）. before making, you need to ensure that your linux is builded with GTK, if not, make it installed in your pc.
Then:
     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.
	
You get lot of messages running upwards. 
After compiling go into the directory 'src' inside 'gchat_client' directory, 
you will see the binary file named 'gchat'. 
Run that to see the 'gchat_client' GUI interface. 
Make sure that 'gchat_server' is already running, 
so that your requests are accepted.
