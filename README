			GCHAT - Readme file

gchat is an instant messenger application to communicate with people. 
It has gchat_server and gchat_client. 
gchat_server runs in CUI and gchat_client in GUI. 

INSTALLATION:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Copy the tar file to any folder and untar that.

  $ tar -jzxf gchat.tar.gz

Now the 'gchat' folder contains two folders 
'gchat_client'and 'gchat_server'. 
Installing these two are given below.

gchat_server:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Go into the 'gchat_server' directory. There will be an binary file 
named 'gchat_server'.You can straight away run that or you can compile 
the application and create a new one. To comlipe type 

  $ gcc gchat_server.c -o gchat_server -pthread

You will get the binary named 'gchat_server'. Run that!!
To add users to the gchat use the 'addUsers' binary file. 
When you run that you will get four options, add, display, delete and 
exit.Go for the option you want and you will be prompted with messages 
for all that you do. 

gchat_client:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.  If you're
     using `csh' on an old version of System V, you might need to type
     `sh ./configure' instead to prevent `csh' from trying to execute
     `configure' itself.

     Running `configure' takes awhile.  While running, it prints some
     messages telling which features it is checking for.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Optionally, type `make check' to run any self-tests that come with
     the package.

  4. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.
	
You get lot of messages running upwards. 
After compiling go into the directory 'src' inside 'gchat_client' directory, 
you will see the binary file named 'gchat'. 
Run that to see the 'gchat_client' GUI interface. 
Make sure that 'gchat_server' is already running, 
so that your requests are accepted.
